## Running Dual_Brains_Visualization

 - Download and install [Processing](https://processing.org/)
 - Download [hypermedia](https://ubaa.net/shared/processing/udp/)'s' Processing library and unzip it into the Processing/Libraries folder.
 - Open `Dual_Brains_Visualization/Dual_Brains_Visualization.pde` in Processing and press ‚ñ∂Ô∏è.

## Sending data from OpenBCI to Dual_Brains_Visualization

- You will need to have Python 2.7 installed (locally or in a virtual env) and some dependencies:
  - serial
  - numpy
  - scipy

- You will also need to be sure that OpenBCI drivers are properly installed. See [Driver Setup fro OpenBCI](http://docs.openbci.com/OpenBCI%20Software/01-OpenBCI_GUI#the-openbci-gui-hardwaredriver-setup-for-openbci_gui-and-openbcihub) for more info.

- Run this command to install all dependencies at once:

  ```pip2 install -r requirements.txt```

- If you have an OpenBCI connected to the computer, you can stream the data to the visualization like this:

  ```python2 python/data_buffer.py --serial-port /path/to/the/serial/port```

- If you don't an OpenBCI connected, you can stream pre-recorded test data to the visualization like this:

  ```python2 python/data_buffer.py --test-file /path/to/test/file.txt```

  *Different test files are provided in the `aaron_test_data` folder*
