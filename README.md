## Running Dual_Brains_Visualization

 - Download and install [Processing](https://processing.org/)
 - Install 2 Processing libraries (Tools->Add Tool->Libraries) : ControlP5 and UDP (¬†hypermedia's Processing library). Hypermedia's lib can also be gotten at [hypermedia](https://ubaa.net/shared/processing/udp/)
 - Open `Dual_Brains_Visualization/Dual_Brains_Visualization.pde` in Processing and press ‚ñ∂Ô∏è.

## Sending data from OpenBCI to Dual_Brains_Visualization

- You will need to have Python 2.7 installed (locally or in a virtual env) and some dependencies:
  - serial
  - numpy
  - scipy
  - pip

- You will also need to be sure that OpenBCI drivers are properly installed and configured. See [Driver Setup from OpenBCI](http://docs.openbci.com/OpenBCI%20Software/01-OpenBCI_GUI#the-openbci-gui-hardwaredriver-setup-for-openbci_gui-and-openbcihub) for more info.

- Run this command to install all dependencies at once:

  ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

- If you have an OpenBCI connected to the computer, you can stream the data to the visualization like this:

  ```python python/data_buffer.py --serial-port /path/to/the/serial/port```

- If you don't an OpenBCI connected, you can stream pre-recorded test data to the visualization like this:

  ```python python/data_buffer.py --test-file /path/to/test/file.txt```

  *Different test files are provided in the `aaron_test_data` folder*
  
## Dual Brains Performance Notes
  
### Set up before:

- Confirm Mac USB port names for Dual brains connection. Example of port name: /dev/tty.PL2303-xxx
- To list all ports (long listing): 
 ```ls -l /dev/tty.*```
 
### To run the program:

- Start Processing and open Dual_Brain_Visualization from the folder Documents/Dual_Brains. Make sure you've selected which monitor to use for display. 

- To Start the connection with the OpenBCI using the Python script from the Documents/Dual_Brains folder, type:
```python python/data_buffer.py --serial-port /dev/tty.usbserial-DQ007RRX (or whatever the serial port name is)```

- If you want to run the Python script with test data instead:
 ```python python/data_buffer.py --test-file aaron_test_data/OpenBCI-RAW-aaron+eva.txt ```
